The error `sudo: apt-get: command not found` confirms that **WiFiSlax does not use Debian/Ubuntu's `apt` package manager**. Since WiFiSlax is based on **Slax** (a lightweight, portable Linux distribution derived from Slackware), it uses a different package management system. Here's how to proceed:

---

### **Why This Happens**
- WiFiSlax/Slax uses **Slackware-style package management** (e.g., `.sb` modules or Slackware packages) instead of Debian/Ubuntu tools like `apt` or `dpkg`.
- You need to use methods compatible with Slax's architecture.

### **Solutions to Install Google Chrome (or Alternatives)**

#### **1. Use the Pre-Installed Browser**
WiFiSlax usually includes **Firefox** or **Midori**. Open one of these browsers and navigate to `https://www.google.com`. No installation is needed.

---

#### **2. Download Google Chrome as a Portable Binary**
If you specifically need Google Chrome:
1. Download the **Linux tarball** directly from Google:
   ```bash
   wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_x86_64.tar.gz
   ```
2. Extract the files:
   ```bash
   tar -xvf google-chrome-stable_current_x86_64.tar.gz
   ```
3. Run Chrome directly from the extracted folder:
   ```bash
   cd google-chrome
   ./chrome
   ```

---

#### **3. Use Slax Modules (`.sb` Files)**
WiFiSlax uses modular packages (`.sb` files). Check if a Google Chrome module exists:
1. Open the `/modules` directory in WiFiSlax.
2. If a `chrome.sb` module exists, activate it by placing it in `/modules` and rebooting.
3. If not, search for Slax-compatible modules online (e.g., [Slax Modules Repository](http://www.slax.org/modules.php)).

---

#### **4. Install via Slackware Packages**
WiFiSlax is Slackware-based, so you can use Slackware packages (`.txz` files). However, this is **advanced** and may break the system:
1. Download Google Chrome for Slackware (search for `.txz` packages online).
2. Install using `installpkg`:
   ```bash
   sudo installpkg google-chrome-*.txz
   ```
   > **Note:** Dependency issues may arise, as WiFiSlax is stripped down.

---

#### **5. Switch to a Different Distribution**
If you need full package management (e.g., `apt`, `dpkg`), consider switching to:
- **Kali Linux** (for penetration testing, includes `apt` and pre-installed tools).
- **Ubuntu** or **Debian** (general-purpose, supports `apt`).

---

### **Summary**
- Use the pre-installed browser for Google services.
- For Google Chrome, try the **portable binary** or **Slax modules**.
- Avoid forcing Debian/Ubuntu tools on WiFiSlax, as it’s not designed for them.
